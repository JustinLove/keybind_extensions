# Keybind Extensions

More possible functions for key binding.

## Features

### Camera

Toggle, start, and a stop a middle-button-line mode where the planet follows the pointer.  This only uses the regular kepress event keybinding logic, so it is not hold to grab like a mouse button.

Focus planet 1-16.  There is also a patch that makes next and previous planet work always focus a planet when you were focused on the sun.

### Alternate ESC/Back

I tend to hit ESC too many times and end up with an option menu.  Breaks out all the pieces.  Tip: keep the basic version bound to something in case the mod gets turned off for any reason.

- Modal back (no menu)
- Open option menu
- Close option menu
- Toggle option menu
- Close chronocam
- Cancel selection
- Clear build sequence
- End fab mode
- End command mode
